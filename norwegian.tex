\chapter{Writing Norwegian in \LaTeX{}}
While this book is written to suit international readers, it is no secret that a large part of its (initial) audience will be Norwegians. Therefore, we have taken extra measures to cover \LaTeX{}-subtleties relevant for the Norwegian language in this appendix.

First, to write a document in Norwegian, it is important that you use the UTF-8 encoding. Otherwise the Norwegian characters æ, ø and å may show up incorrectly. Next, the option to the \latexin{babel} package should be \latexin{norsk} for bokmål or \latexin{nynorsk} for nynorsk.

Norwegian quotation marks look like <<this>>, which is written like \latexin{<<this>>}.
